It also imports models from `com.ingka.selling.spe.models.pricecart.response` package for handling price cart details. Additionally, it imports several models and functions from `fullserve.adapters.orders.models` and `fullserve.repositories.delivery.models.deliveryarrangements` packages for handling order and delivery details.\n\n## Function: createOrderRequest\n\nThis function is used to create an order request. It takes the following parameters:\n\n- `items`: A list of pairs, each containing a `SpeCartItem` and a `ReservationId`.\n- `productTotal`: A `SpeCartOrderSubtotalPrice` object representing the total price of the products.\n- `summaryPrice`: A `SpeCartSummary` object representing the summary of the price cart.\n- `currencyCode`: A string representing the currency code.\n- `orderNumberId`: A string representing the order number ID.\n- `orderNumberSource`: A string representing the order number source.\n- `contactDetails`: A `ContactDetails` object representing the contact details of the customer.\n- `countryCode`: A string representing the country code.\n- `languageCode`: A string representing the language code.\n- `storeId`: A string representing the store ID.\n- `consumerName`: A string representing the name of the consumer.\n- `selectedTimeWindow`: A `CheckoutTimeWindowsResponse` object representing the selected time window for delivery.\n- `deliveryArrangementsResponse`: A `CheckoutDeliveryArrangementsResponse` object representing the delivery arrangements response.\n- `checkoutTimeWindowId`: A string representing the checkout time window ID.\n- `deliveryPrice`: A `SpeCartOrderSubtotalPrice` object representing the delivery price.\n\nThe function returns an `OrderCreationRequest` object.\n\nThe function first creates an `OrderSummary` object, which includes savings and total amount details. Then, it creates an `OrderPayment` object, which includes payment details. The function is incomplete and the implementation of the `OrderPayment` object is not shown."}
